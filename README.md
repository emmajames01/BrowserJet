Multiple sessions on a site
Open as many sessions on the same website as you want with our browser, you don’t need to run proxies to hide your identity. Get a different cookie jar for each tab so you can run many sessions at once.

You can also capture your screen into the image by clicking on the capture icon. This allows you to save the information you need while browsing the web with a different geo-location.

I’ve tried using BrowserJet as my main browser for a full month now and the team is definitely on the right track. The design emphasizes simplicity, but there are also a few playful touches like the option to save credentials and view the same URL on multiple tabs.
